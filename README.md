===========================

Experimental development of Cyanogenmod 11 for the Vodafone Smart 2 aka. Alcatel V860 or MTC 962

This is literally my first shot at porting Android, and we can clearly put up the statement that it sounds like something not too easy. Ancient 2.3 is getitng on my nerves, it performs terrible. Galaxy Y and Pocket (probably) are using the same Broadcomm SoC and they have already gave away the source code for the whole thing. Since i've seen the 2 before mentioned devices running CM11, i was like, okay, i can do that too. Let's get to it.. So, there we are.
